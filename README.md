Overview of Simple Calculator

Project Overview

The Simple Calculator is a fundamental console-based application developed in Java. Its primary function is to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project serves as an introductory example of how to handle user inputs, execute basic mathematical calculations, and display results using Java.

Key Features

•	Addition: Computes the sum of two user-provided numbers.

•	Subtraction: Calculates the difference between two numbers.

•	Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers to find the product.

•	Division: Divides one number by another, with handling for division by zero errors.

Technical Details

•	Language: Java

•	Environment: Console-based application

•	Libraries: Uses Java’s built-in Scanner class for input handling.

How It Works

1.	User Input: The calculator prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an arithmetic operation from a set of options (+, -, *, /).
2.	
3.	Calculation Execution: Based on the chosen operation, the calculator performs the corresponding arithmetic calculation:
4.	
o	Addition: num1 + num2

o	Subtraction: num1 - num2

o	Multiplication: num1 * num2

o	Division: num1 / num2 (with a check to prevent division by zero)

6.	Output: Displays the result of the operation. If the user enters an invalid operation or attempts division by zero, an appropriate error message is shown.
7.	
Code Structure

•	Calculator Class: Contains the main method that drives the application. It handles user input, performs calculations, and outputs results.

•	Error Handling: Basic checks are in place for invalid operations and division by zero scenarios.

Learning Objectives

•	Basic Java Syntax: Understand fundamental Java syntax and programming constructs.

•	User Input Handling: Learn how to read user input from the console.

•	Control Flow: Implement and utilize switch statements to handle different operations.

•	Arithmetic Operations: Perform basic arithmetic calculations in Java.

•	Error Handling: Implement basic error handling for common issues such as invalid input and division by zero.

Conclusion

The Simple Calculator project is an excellent starting point for beginners to practice Java programming. It demonstrates essential concepts and provides a foundation for building more complex applications. By working on this project, developers can enhance their understanding of Java basics and gain hands-on experience with console-based applications.
